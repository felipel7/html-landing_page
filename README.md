# Landing Page

This project is a hands-on journey to enhance HTML authoring skills, inspired by a [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1205515619235206787). It emphasizes the use of semantic HTML elements aligned with official [ specifications](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/) and serves as a simple landing page exercise without relying on frameworks.
